  `shift handover paperwork. He worked within that scope.

On safety awareness and HSEQ compliance, he wears the correct PPE and follows site rules without being ` +
  `prompted, applying them consistently across the shift whether the task is routine or not. He does not ` +
  `need to be reminded of his obligations and sets a reliable standard for those working alongside him.

Before any task begins, he checks that all control measures identified by the TRA are in place and does ` +
  `not allow work to proceed until he is satisfied the barriers are correct. Where a control measure is ` +
  `missing or has not been properly established, he raises it before the job starts rather than after. ` +
  `This is consistent habit, not something he does selectively.

He participates in toolbox talks in accordance with Northwind Offshore requirements, attends them prepared, and ` +
  `contributes what he has seen on the job. His input is practical and reflects a clear understanding of ` +
  `the task at hand.

He communicates effectively with the operational team throughout the shift. Information is passed ` +
  `clearly at handover, issues are flagged promptly, and the team is kept informed of progress. This ` +
  `reduces the risk of misunderstanding during critical phases of the operation.`;
